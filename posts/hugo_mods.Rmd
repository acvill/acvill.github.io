There are many existing blog posts and help pages explaining how to build a Hugo site using blogdown, the best of which is [*Creating Websites with R Markdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill. But, as when learning anything new, I found myself asking questions about Hugo site formatting and functionality that were not answered by the "how-to" guides. Here, I've collected links and code snippets addressing questions about how to toggle features and change the appearance of blogdown site elements. For sure, there are better ways to implement the changes I describe, and my mixed use of markdown syntax with HTML can be considered hacky at best. But, for those like me who are unfamiliar with CSS, I hope this is useful.

  analogous files from other Hugo flavors.

### How to scale images and format image captions

When creating a blogdown post, standard image markdown can be used to insert pictures with captions.

```
![Caption text](/path/to/image.png "Alternative text")
```
While simple and functional, I think the aesthetics can be improved. First, by default, images are scaled to 100% of the page width, but I think some flanking whitespace looks nice. RStudio IDE supports [Pandoc](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/pandoc.html) notation, so you can simply include a percent width parameter in brackets after the image. Adding `center` tags aligns the picture in the center of the page, but newlines between the tags and the image text are needed in order to render the caption.

```
# This:
<center>

![Caption text](/path/to/image.png "Alternative text"){ width=50% }

</center>

# Not this:
<center>
![Caption text](/path/to/image.png "Alternative text"){ width=50% }
</center>
```

Second, I found the default caption text to be too similar to the text in the post body. To remedy this, I include the `style` tag with attributes for `p.caption` in the body of my Rmarkdown posts, specifying the size, color, alignment, and left/right margins of the caption as a percent of page width. 

```
<style>
p.caption {
  font-size: 0.9em;
  text-align: center;
  color: purple;
  margin-right: 5%;
  margin-left: 5%;
}
</style>
```

Altogether, these code snippets make for nicely scaled images with captions that stand out from the main text. 

```
<center>

![So regal. Such panache.](/img/posts/sunny.jpg "His royal majesty, Sunny"){ width=50% }

</center>
```
<center>

![So regal. Such panache.](/img/posts/sunny.jpg "His royal majesty, Sunny"){ width=50% }

</center>

### How to add and change icons for social accounts

The `config.toml` file from the hyde-hyde example site includes a preconfigured list of social accounts that can be included in the sidebar, some of which are commented out. Some popular websites are not included in this list; specifically, I wanted to include an icon linking to my Stack Exchange network account. To accomplish this, I edited `layouts/partials/sidebar/social.html` to include the following:

```
{{ with .Site.Params.social.stackexchange }}
	<a href="https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/{{.}}" rel="me"><i class="fab fa-stack-exchange fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
	{{ end }}
```

Then, I added the `stackexchange` parameter with my Stack Exchange user ID and name to `config.toml`:

```
## Social Accounts
[params.social]
    stackexchange = "52196/acvill"
    linkedin = "albert-vill-a457821a1"
    twitter = "_AlbertVill"
    orcid = "0000-0001-5982-0298"
    email = "albertcvill@gmail.com"
```

Note that the order of icons in the sidebar is determined by the order of sites provided in `social.html` and not the order of parameters listed in `[params.social]`. Explicitly, the left-right order of icons in the sidebar corresponds to the top-bottom order of sites in `social.html`. From my searching, Hugo seems to source its unicode glyphs from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons). This means that you can easily personalize your Hugo site by swapping out the default icon HTML for the HTML provided on each Font awesome icon page. For example, hyde-hyde uses <i class="fas fa-at"></i> to represent email.

```
<i class="fas fa-at"></i>
```
But this can be swapped for a variety of other icons. 

```
<i class="fab fa-envelope"></i>
<i class="fab fa-envelope-square"></i>
<i class="fab fa-paper-plane"></i>
```
<i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>
<i class="fas fa-envelope-square"></i>
<i class="fas fa-paper-plane"></i>

### How to change the maximum width of Hugo site pages

When viewed on a desktop, hyde-hyde leaves a lot of white space on the right side of the page. Ryan Cummings describes a simple fix in their [blog](https://blog.ryanwcummings.com/posts/hugo-width-adjustment/). Just navigate to `assets/scss/hyde-hyde/_variables.scss` and edit the `$content-max-width` variable. 

<style>
p.caption {
  font-size: 0.9em;
  text-align: center;
  color: purple;
  margin-right: 5%;
  margin-left: 5%;
}
</style>
