  <summary>Background:pizza::petri_dish:</summary>

I am from New Jersey. New Yorkers may think they have better bagels and pizza, but they're wrong. 

I graduated from Gettysburg College in 2016 with a B.S. in biochemistry and molecular biology. As a first-generation college student, I got my initial exposure to scientific research in the [PhagesRock lab](https://xsigsummer.wordpress.com/?s=phage) under the mentorship of professors VÃ©ronique Delesalle and Greg Krukonis. 

After undergrad, I enrolled at Cornell University as a graduate student in the field of Genetics, Genomics & Development, and shortly thereafter joined [the Brito Lab](https://www.britolab.org) in the Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering. My graduate work involved the application of different sequencing techniques to understand the DNA and RNA content of the human gut microbiome.

I defended my thesis in April 2022, titled *Metagenomic Methods to Investigate Mobile Element Context and Nascent Transcription in the Human Gut Microbiome*.

Currently, I am postdoc with Paul Turner in the [Center for Phage Biology and Therapy at Yale](http://www.yalephagecenter.com/).

I am interested in bacterial genomics, host-microbe interactions, and all things bacteriophage. My training is in molecular biology with a focus on DNA and RNA sequencing of microbiomes.

As a graduate student, I used [precision run-on sequencing](https://doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2016.086) to assess nascent transcription in bacteria. When applied to human stool samples, PRO-seq captures transcription at metagenomic loci that are co-transcriptionally processed, including tRNAs and CRISPR arrays. Our manuscript is now published in [*Nature Microbiology*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01558-w).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My favorite result: PRO-seq captures active transcription across <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CRISPR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CRISPR</a> arrays, and patterns suggest that endonuclease processing of crRNAs is concurrent with pre-crRNA transcription <a href="https://t.co/vS1tbBI94x">pic.twitter.com/vS1tbBI94x</a></p>&mdash; Albert Vill (@_AlbertVill) <a href="https://twitter.com/_AlbertVill/status/1519751344273465344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The Brito Lab is continuing to innovate in the microbiome mobile gene space with techniques like [OIL-PCR](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.66834) and [GCN models for HGT prediction](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abj5056).

I love R and I appreciate well-documented bioinformatics tools. When I write a handy piece of code, I like to optimize it for ease-of-use. Please see [my code & resources page](https://albertvill.com/projects) for descriptions of tools and scripts that I've developed as part of my ongoing research in metagenomics and bacterial genetics.
