Husband :couple: Scientist :microscope: Phage Phanatic :space_invader:

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the [Brito Lab](https://www.britolab.org) at Cornell University.  My scientific interests include bacterial genomics, host-microbe interactions, and all things bacteriophage.

I'm a regular contributor on [Biology Stack Exchange](https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/52196/acvill). Come ask a question!
