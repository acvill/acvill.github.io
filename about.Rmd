Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the [Brito Lab](https://www.britolab.org) at Cornell University in the field of Genetics, Genomics & Development.  I am interested in bacterial genomics, host-microbe interactions, and all things bacteriophage.

I'm a regular contributor on [Biology Stack Exchange](https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/52196/acvill). Come ask a question!

I have two cats :cat2::cat2:, brothers named Butch Cassidy (black) and the Sundance Kid (tuxedo).
