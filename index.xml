      <description>Husband üë´ Scientist üî¨ Phage Phanatic üëæ
Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the Brito Lab at Cornell University. My scientific interests include bacterial genomics, host-microbe interactions, and all things bacteriophage.
I&amp;rsquo;m a regular contributor on Biology Stack Exchange. Come ask a question!
I have two cats üêàüêà, brothers named Butch Cassidy (black) and the Sundance Kid (tuxedo).</description>

      <title>Restriction enzyme sites across bacterial genomes - implications for metagenomics</title>

      <description>Restriction enzymes (REs) have been the workhorses of molecular biology for decades.1 Primarily considered tools of cloning, REs have found a place in some next-generation sequencing techniques that require efficient production of defined DNA ends for subsequent modification and ligation. For example, most flavors of genome-wide chromosome conformation capture use one or two REs to fragment DNA before dilute ligation of fixed chromatin complexes.2,3 Additionally, chromatin accessibility can be inferred by sequencing RE-digested chromatin4,5, though such methods are less popular than those which utilize sequence-agnostic enzymes like DNase-seq6 and ATAC-seq.</description>
