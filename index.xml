      <description>There are many existing blog posts and help pages explaining how to build a Hugo site using blogdown, the best of which is Creating Websites with R Markdown by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill. But, as when learning anything new, I found myself asking questions about Hugo site formatting and functionality that were not answered by the ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù guides. Here, I‚Äôve collected links and code snippets addressing questions about how to toggle features and change the appearance of blogdown site elements.</description>

      <title>Restriction enzyme sites across bacterial genomes - implications for metagenomics</title>

      <description>Restriction enzymes (REs) have been the workhorses of molecular biology for decades.1 Primarily considered tools of cloning, REs have found a place in some next-generation sequencing techniques that require efficient production of defined DNA ends for subsequent modification and ligation. For example, most flavors of genome-wide chromosome conformation capture use one or two REs to fragment DNA before dilute ligation of fixed chromatin complexes.2,3 Additionally, chromatin accessibility can be inferred by sequencing RE-digested chromatin4,5, though such methods are less popular than those which utilize sequence-agnostic enzymes like DNase-seq6 and ATAC-seq.</description>
